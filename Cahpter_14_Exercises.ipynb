    "In this assignment, you will create a database named student_info.db that holds the following information about students at a college:\n",
    "\n",
    "• The student’s name\n",
    "• The student’s major\n",
    "• The department in which the student is enrolled\n",

    "The database should have the following tables: Majors, Departments, and Students\n",

    "• Write a program that creates the database and the tables.\n",
    "• Write a program that performs CRUD operations on the Majors table. \n",

    "Specifically, the program should allow the user to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "___ Add a new major\n",
    "___ Search for an existing major\n",
    "___ Update an existing major\n",
    "___ Delete an existing major\n",
